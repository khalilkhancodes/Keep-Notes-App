# 🗒️ Keep Notes – Smart Note-Taking with Secure Authentication

> A modern React-based note-taking application that allows each user to manage their notes securely using **Clerk Authentication**. Built for a seamless, dynamic, and personalized experience.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Keep Notes** is a responsive note-taking app built with **React (Vite setup)**, designed for users who want to organize and manage their personal notes easily.  
It supports **authentication**, ensuring each user’s notes remain private and separate.  
Data is stored locally for quick access, and the user interface is enhanced with **Tailwind CSS** and smooth animations from **Framer Motion**.  
Future updates plan to integrate a complete **MERN Stack** backend for manual authentication and cloud data persistence.
